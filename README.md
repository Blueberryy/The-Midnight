# NOTICE
This branch was an attempt to port 1.15.2 features and the new rift into 1.14.4. It was definitely an experiment and I didn't like how it was turning out, so I'm reverting back to the old 1.14.4 branch to simply fix bugs on that version until Forge LTS no longer supports that version. This branch continues to exist *solely* for historical purposes.

# The Midnight  
The *Midnight* is a mod being developed by Cryptic Mushroom that adds a new, mysterious and scary dimension to explore. It is a dimension of darkness; the only light comes from crystals and the various life of the dimension. You may travel willingly to this dimension, though you may unwillingly encounter a rifter and be dragged into this strange and hostile world...  
This is the official source code repository for The Midnight mod, originally made for SpookyJam 2018.

### How to get to The Midnight

#### For Users  
To get to the dimension, you will need to find a rift. These will spawn in red clumps of matter. Though before you go, make sure to be prepared! The Midnight is a hostile place.

#### For Developers  
We understand can be annoying to have to find a rift to access The Midnight every time. Here are a couple of commands to find/access the dimension with ease.  
Summon a Rift entity: `/locate midnight:entrance_rift`  
Teleport directly into The Midnight: `/forge setdimension @p midnight:midnight`
