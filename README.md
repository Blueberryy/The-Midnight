# The Midnight  
The *Midnight* is a mod being developed by Cryptic Mushroom that adds a new, mysterious and scary dimension to explore. It is a dimension of darkness; the only light comes from crystals and the various life of the dimension. You may travel willingly to this dimension, though you may unwillingly encounter a rifter and be dragged into this strange and hostile world...  
This is the official source code repository for The Midnight mod, originally made for SpookyJam 2018.

### How to get to The Midnight

#### For Developers
In the current version of The Midnight, rifts are currently not implemented as a rewrite of them is in progress. Here is a command to access The Midnight without need of a rift.  
Teleport directly into The Midnight: `/forge setdimension @p midnight:midnight`
