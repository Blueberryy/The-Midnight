# The Midnight

**IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT:** The Midnight is being completely rewritten from the ground up for better stability and performance! More info on the rewrite to come very soon.

*The Midnight* is a mod being developed by Cryptic Mushroom that adds a new, mysterious and scary dimension to explore. It is a dimension of darkness; the only light comes from crystals and the various life of the dimension. You may travel willingly to this dimension, though you may unwillingly encounter a rifter and be dragged into this strange and hostile world...
