# The Midnight  
The *Midnight* is a mod being developed by Cryptic Mushroom that adds a new, mysterious and scary dimension to explore. It is a dimension of darkness; the only light comes from crystals and the various life of the dimension. You may travel willingly to this dimension, though you may unwillingly encounter a rifter and be dragged into this strange and hostile world...  
This is the official source code repository for The Midnight mod, originally made for SpookyJam 2018.

## Note for the 1.15.2-newrift branch
**This branch is home to the rift portal rewrite that will be released for 1.15.2. Nothing here may work as intended. If you want to test the mod with no rifts (for now), go to the 1.15.2 branch.**

### How to get to The Midnight

#### For Users
To get to the dimension, you will need to find a rift. These will spawn randomly during the night both above ground and in caves. Though before you go, make sure to be prepared! The Midnight is a hostile place.

#### For Developers
Sometimes when we update the mod, the rift to get to The Midnight is broken. In some cases, it can be annoying to have to spawn or summon a rift to access the dimension every time. Here is a command to access the dimension with ease.  
/forge setdimension @p midnight:midnight
