# **The Midnight**

**IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT:** The Midnight is being completely rewritten from the ground up for better stability and performance! For more information on the rewrite, join our Discord server and check out #announcements, or ask us in there directly!

*The Midnight* is a mod being developed by Cryptic Mushroom that adds a new, mysterious and scary dimension to explore. It is a dimension of darkness; the only light comes from crystals and the various life of the dimension. You may travel willingly to this dimension, though you may unwillingly encounter a rifter and be dragged into this strange and hostile world...

**Minecraft 1.12.2 - 1.14.4:** To get to the dimension, you will need to find a glowing, red rift. These will spawn randomly during the night both above ground and in caves. Rifts are often accompanied by unfriendly figures known as rifters.

**Minecraft 1.15.2:** To get to the dimension, you will need to find a red heap of mass in the overworld. At night time, the portal will activate, and you will be able to traverse into The Midnight. Though before you go into The Midnight, make sure to be prepared! The Midnight does not welcome newcomers.

## Issues and Compatibility

If you have found any issues with our mod, you can click the "Issues" tab at the top of this page to go to our issue tracker.  
Although you may report issues on the latest version of The Midnight, do note that our focus has shifted onto the rewrite, so the bugs may not be fixed in the 1.15.2 version of The Midnight, and instead accounted for in the rewrite.  
Please note that if your issue is a duplicate of anyone else's, an active developer may remove your issue in order to remove excess clutter.

## FAQ (Will be updated soon)

Q: How do I get out of the dimension?  
A: Find another rift in the dimension, it will lead you back to the Overworld. However, they only spawn at night in the Overworld so if that condition isn't met then you won't find a rift for a while. An alternative option is to use this command (only works on The Midnight 0.4.6 and lower): /summon midnight:rift

Q: Can I use The Midnight in my modpack?  
If you want to incorperate The Midnight into your modpack, feel free, but do know that *The Midnight is extremely buggy when it comes to compatibility with other mods.* This has been address and will be worked on soon.
