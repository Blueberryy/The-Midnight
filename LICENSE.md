## Liability

_THE MIDNIGHT_ IS PROVIDED 'AS IS' WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE _OWNER_ BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH _THE MIDNIGHT_ OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN _THIS MOD_.

Unless explicitly stated in a file itself, or in a file named `NOTICE.txt`, `NOTICE.md` or a comment in `package-info.java` on behalf of the corresponding file, _Cryptic Mushroom_ has full rights over _this mod_ and its _sources_, under the copyright terms when purchasing Minecraft (http://www.minecraft.net/copyright.jsp), despite the use of _Mojang_'s code. The use of _Forge_'s code by the _owner_ is completely legal.

## _Distribution_ and redistribution

_Distribution_ of _this mod_ or its _sources_ is strictly forbidden for every person or other legal entity except when one or more of the following conditions apply to the _distributor_. _Distribution_ is only legal

- when the _distributor_ is a legal _owner_;
- when the _distribution_ is a _distribution_ of _the sources_ in a FORK of the GitHub repository that is published by _Cryptic Mushroom_, AND NOT IN A NEW REPOSITORY;
- when the _distributor_ has a written and valid permission of the _owner_ (may be subject to certain terms and/or conditions);
- when the kind of _distribution_ is via a _mod pack_ on CurseForge, or in a modpack outside CurseForge as long as the _owner_ is informed and a legal distribution is used;
- when the _distribution_ is done privately, via hardware such as external storage, via mail or via other communication platforms such as WhatsApp or Discord with the exception of public servers;
- or when the _distribution_ is on the original CurseForge page of _The Midnight_ or the GitHub Releases/Actions page of this GitHub repository.

Distribution is, regardless of the above conditions, always strictly forbidden

- when the _distributor_ is not a person;
- when the _owner_ does not know about the _distribution_;
- when the _distribution_ yields money or other financial profit to the _distributor_ in any way or kind, including link shorteners like AdFly or BitLy, unless it conforms to one of the exceptions below (see the 'Funding' section);
- when the _distribution_ is distributed under another license than this license;
- or **WHEN _CRYPTIC MUSHROOM_ HAS/HAVE TAKEN AWAY THE _DISTRIBUTOR_'s PERMISSION OF DISTRIBUTING _THIS MOD_ OR ITS _SOURCES_ IN ANY OTHER KIND OR FORM!**.

When one or more files that are covered by these terms and conditions are distributed illegally, including _sources_ and binaries, modified or not, users may freely ignore any illegally changed terms and conditions that "cover" the corresponding files. In the case any _owner_ asks a user to share an illegally distributed file because of a serious reason given due to the illegal distribution of the file, the user HAS PERMISSION TO, and MUST share that file, regardless of the terms and conditions of the illegal _distributor_.

## Derivative works and/or modification

_This mod_ and its binaries and/or _sources_ are published and may be freely downloaded, decompiled and modified for private use only, either with a decompiler or a bytecode editor, or by cloning the public source code into a local repository. Public _distributions_ of modified versions of _this mod_ are covered by the above statement about _distribution_, under the header "_Distribution_ and/or redistribution". **THE _OWNER_ IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY MODIFYING, EXECUTING, USING OR RUNNING MODIFIED VERSIONS OF _THIS MOD_ AND/OR ITS _SOURCES_!**

## _Contribution_

_Contribution_ to _this mod_ and/or its _sources_ is allowed under the following conditions:

- The _contributor_ must suggest modifications using Issues or Pull Requests on GitHub.
- The _contributor_ must follow the contribution guidelines.
- The _contributor_ may NOT contribute when an _owner_ has forbidden the _contributor_ to contribute.
- The _contributor_ must sign the Contributor License Agreement given to them when they post their GitHub PR.
- The _contribution_ must be voluntary.
By contributing, _contributors_ automatically agree that an _owner_ shares and distributes this contribution legally.

## Signature

The binaries that are released on the GitHub releases/actions page or on the CurseForge page (see the links on the right) are signed with a digital signature. If this signature is violated on a certain binary, the _owner_ can assume that binary is a modified version of _The Midnight_, unless the signature is violated because it is expired. Usually, these modified versions are distributed illegally.

## Funding

Raising money from _this mod_ or any of its counterparts is strictly forbidden, except when the money is raised via the official Patreon page of _Cryptic Mushroom_ and all goes to the profit of _Cryptic Mushroom_ and is all used to fund development. In no event shall any other entity raise money from _this mod_ or its counterparts. Not by funding, not by selling, not by ads, not by link shorteners (including but not limited to AdFly or BitLy) and not in any other way not mentioned in this list.
