# Frequently Asked Questions

We get a lot of frequently asked questions on our Discord server, so apart from answering them in the #faq channel in our server, I thought I'd make a seperate page on this wiki regarding those as well.  
Special thanks to our moderator 123wdog for maintaining the FAQ on the Discord server!

### Why is development so slow?

Loads of reasons, the main one being life. We all have lives outside of mod development, and it just isn't economically stable to work solely on Minecraft mods and nothing else. Despite this, we are spending our free time to deliver some fun and interesting mods, so give us some slack if things seem to halt from time-to-time.

### What are your current mods (by Cryptic Mushroom)?

The current active mod we've got is The Midnight for 1.15.2, with a 1.16 port in the works. While we do have other projects on the back burner, it is unlikely that these will be touched until we feel The Midnight is in a state where we could potentially call it "complete."

### Something broke in the 1.12.2/1.14.4 version.

**We no longer are supporting the 1.12.2/1.14.4 versions of The Midnight!** If you have an issue with a version that isn't 1.15.2, we often won't be able to help!

### I have an issue with the 1.15.2 version. What do I do?

Send us a crash log or description of what the issue is in either the #support channel on our Discord server or in our Midnight issue tracker. Do **not** send bug reports in the #the-midnight channel on our Discord server.

### How do I install the mod?

First, make sure you have at least forge version `31.2.45`, then go into your `%appdata%/roaming/.minecraft/mods` folder and put the .jar file of the mod you got from Curseforge inside of it. Make sure you've downloaded the mod from the Curseforge page, as that is the only official download of the mod. **Any other location that says it can give you our mod is not supported by us and could potentially install malware into your computer! We are not responsible should this happen from downloading the mod off a dangerous site!**

### I've got the mod installed. Where's all the new content?

To actually experience The Midnight, you're going to need to find a rift. This can either be done by exploring your world for a red, organic-looking structure, using the `/locate midnight:entrance_rift` command, or clicking the ground with a `Dark Pearl`. If you are using the older versions of the mod, rifts are instead entities that will spawn during the night.

### When I use shaders, The Midnight looks weird!

If you want a shader pack that is compatible with the Midnight, try [Complementary Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders)! The author of this shaderpack has done a very good job when it comes to compatibility with mods, including the lovely Midnight!

### The Midnight plant textures become purple and black when I'm using Better Foliage.

...Get rid of Better Foliage...  
This is an issue that's also been here since release and isn't anything that we can fix. Your best bet is just to remove Better Foliage.

### Are you currently working on a 1.16.4 version of The Midnight?

Yes we are! We are completely rewriting The Midnight from the ground up for better stability, performance, and overall gameplay experience. If you want to see what is currently planned for the rewrite and what our current focuses are, go to [the Midnight Wiki's rewrite page](https://the-midnight.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rewrite/).
