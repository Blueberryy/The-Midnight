# Credits

This mod is a huge collaborative effort with tons of different ideas, coding, and textures pitched in by varying individuals who came together to build something great. We wouldn't be where we are today without the help of those here today and those who worked on this mod in the past. Below is a list of members who participated in the development of The Midnight.  
If you are a contributor on this list and want your name to link to a different site, don't hesitate to let anyone on The Midnight Development Team know. You can find us on our discord server.
