PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING BEFORE PROCEEDING:
1. If you delete this entire template and go your own path, The Midnight Development Team may close your issue without further explanation or engagement unless the issue you posted is critical to the mod.
2. Feel free to provide multiple suggestions in your issue, but try to keep it at a certain theme and have the title reflect that.
3. If you suggest an enhancement that has many duplicates, The Midnight Development Team team may close your issue without further explanation or engagement.
4. If you are too vague when suggesting your enhancement, The Midnight Development Team will add the "Vague" label to your issue and will ask you to elaborate. They will close the issue if you don't respond in a few days.
5. If you send a bug report with only a title and no body, The Midnight Development Team will close your issue.

And most importantly:
DO NOT SUGGEST ANY IDEAS SPECIFICALLY FOR THE 1.12.2 or 1.14.4 VERSIONS OF THE MIDNIGHT: THOSE VERSIONS ARE NO LONGER SUPPORTED AND ANY RELATING ISSUE WILL BE CLOSED AND IGNORED!!!

If you understand this, feel free to proceed and write your feature request.

Only request enhancements, don't suggest new content! Valid requests include the addition of a config option on a specific behaviour or special compatibility with a mod. For suggestions, consider posting them in the Discord server instead: https://discord.gg/Rdc86yA. See the #suggestions channel...

Give a full explanation of the feature. Be obvious. Tell us everything about the feature. What should the feature include? Which details are important? Why do you want this feature? Use resources to support your explanation (images, code blocks, websites). Please fix your typo's and check your markup (paste code in code blocks, use syntax highlighting where possible, use dashes for unordered lists, etc.).

**Please don't add irrelevant information!!**
