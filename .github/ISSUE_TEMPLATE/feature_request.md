DO NOT REQUEST ANY FEATURES ON THE 1.12.2 VERSIONS OF THE MIDNIGHT: THOSE VERSIONS ARE NO LONGER SUPPORTED AND ANY RELATING REQUEST WILL BE CLOSED AND IGNORED!!!

Only request enhancements, don't suggest new content! Valid requests include the addition of a config option on a specific behaviour or special compatibility with a mod. For suggestions, consider posting them in the Discord server instead: https://discord.gg/Rdc86yA. See the #suggestions channel...

Give a full explanation of the feature. Be obvious. Tell us everything about the feature. What should the feature include? Which details are important? Why do you want this feature? Use resources to support your explanation (images, code blocks, websites). Please fix your typo's and check your markup (paste code in code blocks, use syntax highlighting where possible, use dashes for unordered lists, etc.).

**Please don't add irrelevant information!!**
