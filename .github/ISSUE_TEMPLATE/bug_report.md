PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING BEFORE PROCEEDING:
1. If you delete this entire template and go your own path, The Midnight Development Team may close your issue without further explanation or engagement unless the issue you posted is critical to the mod.
2. If you list multiple bugs/concerns in this one issue, The Midnight Development Team may close your issue and ask you to create seperate issues for each bug..
3. If you write an issue that has many duplicates, The Midnight Development Team team may close your issue without further explanation or engagement.
4. If you are too vague when filing your issue, The Midnight Development Team will add the "Vague" label to your issue and will ask you to elaborate. They will close the issue if you don't respond in a few days.
5. If you send a bug report with only a title and no body, The Midnight Development Team will close your issue.

And most importantly:
DO NOT REPORT ANY ISSUES ON THE 1.12.2 or 1.14.4 VERSIONS OF THE MIDNIGHT: THOSE VERSIONS ARE NO LONGER SUPPORTED AND ANY RELATING ISSUE WILL BE CLOSED AND IGNORED!!!
WE WILL STILL ACCEPT ISSUES ON THE 1.15.2 VERSION OF THE MIDNIGHT, BUT THEY WILL NOT BE FIXED FOR 1.15.2. INSTEAD, THEY WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR THE 1.16.1 VERSION OF THE MIDNIGHT, WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT.

If you understand this, feel free to proceed and write your bug report.
