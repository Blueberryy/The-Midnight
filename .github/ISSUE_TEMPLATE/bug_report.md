DO NOT REPORT ANY ISSUES ON THE 1.12.2 VERSIONS OF THE MIDNIGHT: THOSE VERSIONS ARE NO LONGER SUPPORTED AND ANY RELATING ISSUE WILL BE CLOSED AND IGNORED!!!

Explain the bug:
- What isn't working?
- How to reproduce the problem?
- Does the game crash? How?

#### Additional Info (You can delete this when creating the issue, but please read)
Be clear and concise.

If you have some screenshots, please include them. They are very helpful to understand the issue.

If the game crashes, please paste the crash report here (code block!!) or in a gist/pastebin. When the game crashes, the launcher will probably show you a link to open the crash report (old launchers just shows the crash report itself).

If you have found some remarkable log messages, please include only those messages (code block!!) and paste the complete log file in a gist/pastebin.

#### Environment
- Midnight: [midnight version]
